## Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

The P component is the proportional controller, it changes steering angle in proportion to the cross track error, 
so it is the main component of a PID controller.

With just the P component, as shown in the lecture, the car overshoots and undershoots so it is introduced the next component,
to alleviate oscillations caused by overcorrections. This is theÂ differential - D component in the controller. 
It changes steering in proportion to the derivative of the cross track error. 
The I component is the integral controller calculated as the sum of the errors in the previous time, this helps to increase 
the correction if the error accumulates over time This term is for counteracting systematic bias in the steering and correct
for drift in the real world, but in the simulator it seem there is not any systematic bias, so this parameter is set to a very
low value.

## Describe how the final hyper-parameters were chosen. 
I tuned the Kp, Ki and Kd constants through manual testing. I experimented with the Kp and Kd controller constants
using higher values of Kd until I was able to increase the throttle value to 0.4 and setting the I constant to a very
low value.
